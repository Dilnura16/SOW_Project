<hr><em class="one"> My name is Dilnurakhon Tulanova and I was born in Uzbekistan. I am a 16-year-old sophomore student at high school.<br>
I am the one who is in charge of "Negative thinking" project. My project helps to convey the impacts of negative thinking on any actions,<br>
to  clear up the importance of positive thinking. It serves to change the approach of people to the world and better understanding<br>
of how thoughts affect on their actions.
