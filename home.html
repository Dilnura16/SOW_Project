<h2> Negative thinking</h2>
 <p align="center"> "Thoughts lead on to purposes; purposes go forth in action; <br>
    actions form habits; habit decides character and
    character <br>
    fixes our destiny." <br>-Tryon Edward </p>
 <p align="center"> Most of us think before taking any actions. Our thoughts can be both positive
    and negative.<br>
     However not all of us know that these two instincts can reflect on our actions.
 <br> For this reason, I would like explain what are the consequences of thinking negatively or positively.</p>

 <p align="center">As every person faces a difficulty in their life,
 it depends on person how to take it. However if it is negative, the effects can be accordingly:



  <br><li type=disk>Decreased life span</li>
  <br><li type=disk>Higher rates of depression</li>
  <br><li type=disk>Higher levels of distress</li>
  <br><li type=disk>Less resistance to the common cold</li>

    <h3> Solutions</h3>
    <p> It is easy for you to say:"Well, we can just think positively. The end of story!" However I believe it is not easy as it seems as sometimes<br> we do not notice that we think negatively. That is why, it takes a while to change your thoughts to a positive side.

          <p>1.The easiest way to solve a problem is to have a "Self-talk". Negative thoughts just come, sometimes by surprise. But you can always face these negative thoughts with positive self-talk—even transform these thoughts into positive self-talk. Negative thoughts are usually associated with some troubles or problems, but if you’re positive whenever these thoughts bug you, you could even find solutions to these problems.
          </p>
        <p>2.Another method is writing your negative thoughts. You could write about your negative thoughts, label them as “trash,” and literally throw them away. It’s a gesture that would help you take control over and protect yourself from such thoughts. You can also speak them loudly.
