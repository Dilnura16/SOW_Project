<h2> Negative thinking</h2>
<p align="center"> "Thoughts lead on to purposes; purposes go forth in action; <br>
   actions form habits; habit decides character and
   character <br>
   fixes our destiny." <br>-Tryon Edward </p>
<p align="center"> Most of us think before taking any actions. Our thoughts can be both positive
   and negative.<br>
    However not all of us know that these two instincts can reflect on our actions.
<br> For this reason, I would like explain what are the consequences of thinking negatively or positively.</p>

<p align="center">As every person faces a difficulty in their life,
it depends on person how to take it. However if it is negative, the effects can be accordingly:



 <br><li type=disk>Decreased life span</li>
 <br><li type=disk>Higher rates of depression</li>
 <br><li type=disk>Higher levels of distress</li>
 <br><li type=disk>Less resistance to the common cold</li>
 <br><li type=disk>Problem with psychological and physical well-being</li>
 <br><li type=disk>Problem with coping skills during hardships and times of stress</li>

 <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/a-practical-hack-to-combat-negative-thoughts-in-2-minutes-or-less-cc3d1bddb3af"> According to the research conducted by the National Science Foundation, 80%<br>
     of a person's thoughts are negative.</a>

 <h3> Solutions</h3>
 <p> It is easy for you to say:"Well, we can just think positively. The end of story!" However I believe it is not easy as it seems as sometimes<br> we do not notice that we think negatively. That is why, it takes a while to change your thoughts to a positive side.

       <p>1.The easiest way to solve a problem is to have a "Self-talk". Negative thoughts just come, sometimes by surprise. But you can always face these negative thoughts with positive self-talk—even transform these thoughts into positive self-talk. Negative thoughts are usually associated with some troubles or problems, but if you’re positive whenever these thoughts bug you, you could even find solutions to these problems.
       </p>
     <p>2.Another method is writing your negative thoughts. You could write about your negative thoughts, label them as “trash,” and literally throw them away. It’s a gesture that would help you take control over and protect yourself from such thoughts. You can also speak them loudly.

My plan</h2>
<img src="club.jpg" align="left" height="400px" width="50%">
<img src="club1.jpg" align="right" height=380px width=50%>

<p>
 Abovementioned solutions can be applied individually, but what I am planning to do is to open a club at school for people who  struggle because of their thoughts and want to change the way they approach their life or be more optimistic.
<br> The mission of my club is going to solely based on the positiveness. Whatever we plan to engage, I am going to try to create an atmosphere where nobody feels the lose of confidence or self-esteem.</p>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<p> The group is going to be open for all ages including students, teachers and other workers.
</p>
<p> 1.The first step I want to take is to involve them with different interactive games and make a record of the their involvement rate. <br>
2. Then I am planning to make them rate their positive thinking levels made by myself. <br>
3. By the results of the survey, I would make them explain why they chose the certain rates.<br>
4. In the end, I would make each of the participants to complement to their partners only the POSITVE SIDE of their involvement. </p>
<br><br>
<h1 > Why the positive side only?</h1>

<p>Most people face discouragements without positive compliments. As a result, they lose confidence in any actions. That is why, I am planning to make them feel that they are capable of everything and build their psychological strength
in my club.</p>
