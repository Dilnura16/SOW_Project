<p>
 Abovementioned solutions can be applied individually, but what I am planning to do is to open a club at school for people who  struggle because of their thoughts and want to change the way they approach their life or be more optimistic.
<br> The mission of my club is going to solely based on the positiveness. Whatever we plan to engage, I am going to try to create an atmosphere where nobody feels the lose of confidence or self-esteem.</p>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<p> The group is going to be open for all ages including students, teachers and other workers.
</p>
<p> 1.The first step I want to take is to involve them with different interactive games and make a record of the their involvement rate. <br>
2. Then I am planning to make them rate their positive thinking levels made by myself. <br>
3. By the results of the survey, I would make them explain why they chose the certain rates.<br>
4. In the end, I would make each of the participants to complement to their partners only the POSITVE SIDE of their involvement. </p>
<br><br>
<h1 > Why the positive side only?</h1>

<p>Most people face discouragements without positive compliments. As a result, they lose confidence in any actions. That is why, I am planning to make them feel that they are capable of everything and build their psychological strength
in my club.</p>
